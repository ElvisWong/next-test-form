# React.js MC Test

This repo is inspired by: Ben Awad - [Coding Interviews are Broken](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bx3--22D4E4&t=54s&ab_channel=BenAwad)

The purpose of this test is to show what's the best way to test whether the developer are managed to know React.js

Actually why technical test for developers will be like the exam I have in university that I hated most?

If you want to test the concept for developers using MC questions, at least you should provide enough time to think instead of having less than 1 minute for each questions.

Better way to test a developer is suggested to have a short(ard 20mins) coding test. And ask them about why you would deal with the problem like this, which is better to show their problem-solving skills. And Google search is necessary for every developers to do their daily work.

So..., does cheating matter for developer to work on their technical test??
